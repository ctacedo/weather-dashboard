Weather Dashboard that produces the 5-day forecast of the city that you select.  I used a combine of Jquery and Bootstrap when creating
the website. As for producing the weather, I went ahead and used the OpenWeather Api as instructed.  I also used local storage to create 
and save a list of cities when entered in the website to save on the right-hand side of the page.
